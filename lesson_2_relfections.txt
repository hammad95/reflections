What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates a new git repository in the directory in which you
use the "git init" command.

You need to initialize a git repository in a directory on your machine if you wish to use version
control to manage your work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?

The staging area is a kind of space between the working directory and repository. It allows you
to visualize what changes you are about to commit to the repository.
