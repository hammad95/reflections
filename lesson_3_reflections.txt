When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be used when you are collborating with others on a project. Everyone 
involved would be able to push their own work and pull each other's off of an online repository.
When working on your own, a remote repository could come in handy if you have very low storage on
your device and want to store your changes on an online repository rather than on your machine.
