When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be used when you are collborating with others on a project. Everyone 
involved would be able to push their own work and pull each other's off of an online repository.
When working on your own, a remote repository could come in handy if you have very low storage on
your device and want to store your changes on an online repository rather than on your machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would only want to pull when you want to see if any changes were added to the repository by
other users. If Git automatically does it for you, you wouldn't know if any changes were committed
while you were working on files on your own and you would have to run git log everytime before 
committing any changes.
